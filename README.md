`bakemono`is a cache storage engine implemented in Go.

## üèÅ Design goals
- **ü™∂ Lightweight**: easy to embed in your project
- **üöÄ High-performance**: high throughput and low latency
- **üòÄ Code-readable**: simple but powerful storage design, easy to read and understand

It is highly inspired by [Apache Traffic Server], implemented for our cache-proxy project [hitori].

## üíæ Cache Storage Engine
What is a **cache storage engine**? 
What is the difference from an **embeddable k-v database**?

**Similarities**:
They both are:
- key-value storage
- embeddable
- persistent storage on SSD/HDD

**Differences**:
Cache storage are:
- allowed to drop data when conditions are met
- fault-tolerant (just return a `MISS` when disk failure happens)

Cache storage is common in CDN (Content Delivery Network). It is used to cache frequently accessed data to reduce the load of backend servers.

The size of cache data is usually `~100TiB` per bare-metal server.

## üóùÔ∏è Usage

### Install
You can use `bakemono` as a pkg in your project. 
```bash
go get github.com/bocchi-the-cache/bakemono
```

### Init
Then simply import and init a `Vol` in your code:
```go
func main() {
	cfg, err := bakemono.NewDefaultVolOptions("/tmp/bakemono-test.vol", 1024*512*100000, 1024*1024)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	
	v := &bakemono.Vol{}
	corrupted, err := v.Init(cfg)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	if corrupted {
		log.Printf("vol is corrupted, but fixed. ignore this if first time running.")
	}
	
	// ...
}
```

### Read/Write
```go
func main() {
    // ...
    
    // write
    err = v.Set([]byte("key"), []byte("value"))
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    // read
	hit, data, err := v.Get([]byte("key"))
    if err != nil {
		// note: err can be not nil when disk failure happens
		// consider it as a MISS when err != nil, or log it to do further processing
        panic(err)
    }
    if !hit {
        panic("key should be hit")
    }
    if string(data) != "value" {
        panic("value should be 'value'")
    }
    log.Printf("value: %s", data)
	
	// close
    err = v.Close()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

### Note

**Concurrency RW is supported**.

In this version, they are sharing several RWLocks. We will give more tuning options in the future.

**We highly recommend you to read tech design doc before using it in high-load scenarios.**


## ü§ñ Tech Design
... until now. 

### Data Structure

There are 3 data structures in `bakemono`:

- **`Vol`**
  - **volume**, represents a single file on disk.
  - A `Vol` is what we finally persist on disk.
  - We will support bare block device in the future.
- **`Chunk`**
  - basic unit of your k-v cache data.
  - restored on disk.
- **`Dir`**
  - **directory**, a meta index of `Chunk`.
  - All `Dir`s are loaded in memory. It is compact.

#### Chunk
`Chunk` is the basic unit of cache data.

| name           | data type      | desc                  |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| Magic          | uint32         | fixed: 0x00114514     |
| Checksum       | uint32         | checksum of DataRaw   |
| Key            | [3000]byte     | fixed size key bytes  |
| DataLength     | uint32         |                       |
| HeaderSize     | uint32         | fixed: 4096.          |
| HeaderChecksum | uint32         | checksum of the above |
| DataRaw        | variable bytes | raw data              |

We force set chunk header size to 4KB this version, a sector size.

#### Dir
`Dir` is the meta index of `Chunk`. 

Every `Chunk` has a `Dir` to represent it in memory.

`Dir` is always loaded in memory.
```go
type Dir struct {
	/*
	   unsigned int offset : 24;  // (0,1:0-7)
	   unsigned int bigInternal : 2;      // (1:8-9)
	   unsigned int sizeInternal : 6;     // (1:10-15)
	   unsigned int tag : 12;     // (2:0-11)
	   unsigned int phase : 1;    // (2:12)
	   unsigned int head : 1;     // (2:13)
	   unsigned int pinned : 1;   // (2:14)
	   unsigned int token : 1;    // (2:15)
	   unsigned int next : 16;    // (3)
	   unsigned int offset_high : 16;

	   if unused, raw[2] is `prev`, represents previous dir in freelist.

	   approx_size = sectorSize(512) * (2**3big) * sizeInternal
	*/
	raw [5]uint16
}
```

`Dir` is organized in raw 10 bytes. Use bit operations to get/set fields. This is a design of [Apache Traffic Server].
We must save every bit to reduce memory usage.

Note: if Dir is unused, `raw[2]` is `prev`, represents previous dir in freelist. To save 1 byte.


Memory usage:

If we have `100TB` data with `1MB` chunk size, we only need `100TB/1MB*10B = 1GB` memory to index `Dir`s.


#### Segment, Bucket, Freelist
`Segment` and `Bucket` are logical groups of `Dir`. 

`Segment` is a collection of `Bucket`s. `Bucket` is a collection of `dir`s.

They are logically organized as below:
![./docs/dirs-init.png](./docs/dirs-init.png)


A `bucket` is group of fixed size `4` dirs.

A `segment` has max size `2^16=65536` dirs.

`Dirs` is a linked list. 
When initializing, we will all **non-bucket-head** dirs to freelist, named `freeDirs`.

And there is a `map[segmentId]dirId` to index the first **free dir** of each segment.

Note, dirs is an array in memory.

Why `segments`? We could lock, flush meta per segment.

### Read/Write
TBD

### Metadata Persistence
TBD

## Performance
TBD


## Other Information
### Roadmap
- We are working on basic caching functions in this stage.
- When caching functions are stable, we will concentrate on performance tuning.

### Name Origin
**Bakemono** is a Japanese word meaning "monster". In Chinese, it is called "Ë¥µÁâ©". 

We wish it could be a **lightweight** but **high-performance** cache storage engine like a "bakemono"!
